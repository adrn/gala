# Summary

The forces on stars, galaxies, and dark matter under external gravitational fields lead
to the dynamical evolution of structures in the universe. The orbits of these bodies are
therefore key to understanding the formation, history, and future state of galaxies. The
field of "galactic dynamics," which aims to model the gravitating components of galaxies
to study their structure and evolution, is now well-established, commonly taught, and
frequently used in astronomy. Aside from toy problems and demonstrations, the majority
of problems require efficient numerical tools, many of which require the same base code
(e.g., for performing numerical orbit integration).

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python enables
wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing flexibility or
ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was designed to provide a
class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or Cython-optimized) implementations
of common operations such as gravitational potential and force evaluation, orbit
integration, dynamical transformations, and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics.
`Gala` also relies heavily on and interfaces well with the implementations of physical
units and astronomical coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy]
(`astropy.units` and `astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by students in
courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been used in a number of
scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been used in graduate courses on
Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive visualizations of textbook material
[@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed, design, and support for Astropy functionality
in `Gala` will enable exciting scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from
the _Gaia_ mission [@gaia] by students and experts alike. The source code for `Gala` has
been archived to Zenodo with the linked DOI: [@zenodo]
